AFST 289,Global Blackness and Social Movements,6 credits,"This course considers Black social movements from around the globe, with an emphasis on non-U.S. contexts.  Examining multiple movements both past and present, it takes a comparative approach to understanding the unique and variable ways that Black communities have articulated the Black condition, and mobilized and resisted oppression.  Central to the course is the question of Blackness as a global and transnational identity; as well as the extent to which movements themselves form ties and mutually inform each other across national boundaries.",Spring 2025,"IS, International Studies, SI, Social Inquiry, WR2 Writing Requirement 2","AFST Social Inquiry, SOAN Pertinent, AFST Core, CL: 200 level",,Daniel Williams,"T, TH",Leighton 402,10:10am-11:55am,

In this course we consider how ideas and imaginings of who Latinxs are and what Latinidad is develop within political spaces (the electorate, the census), in local places, and through various media, including television, advertising, and music.

ARBC 371,Readings in Premodern Arabic Science,3 credits,"It is difficult to overstate Arab scientists’ contribution to science. A translation movement from Greek, Persian and Sanskrit into Arabic initiated in the eighth century, led to centuries of innovative scientific investigation, during which Arab scientists reshaped science in a variety of disciplines: from mathematics to astronomy, physics, optics and medicine. Many of their works entered Latin and the European curriculum during the Renaissance. In this reading course we will explore some of the achievements and thought processes in premodern Arabic scientific literature by reading selections from several seminal works. We will examine these in the cultural contexts in which they emerged and to which they contributed, and reflect on modern Western perceptions of this intellectual project.

The course examines the intersecting themes of power, labor, law, race, gender, sexuality, and resistance. It will consider how these themes each shaped the construction of different institutions of enslavement while simultaneously focusing on the experiences of the enslaved who lived and died within in these systems.

This course focuses on the political trajectories of these two rival siblings and looks at the ways in which both states use the other to forge antagonistic and belligerent nations. While this is a survey course it is not a comprehensive overview of the history of the two countries. Instead it covers some of the more significant moments of rupture and violence in the political history of the two states. The first two-thirds of the course offers a top-down, macro overview of these events and processes whereas the last third examines the ways in which people experienced these developments. We use the lens of gender to see how the physical body, especially the body of the woman, is central to the process of nation building.

SOAN 110,Introduction to Anthropology,6 credits,"Anthropology is the study of all human beings in all their diversity, an exploration of what it means to be human throughout the globe. This course helps us to see ourselves, and others, from a new perspective. By examining specific analytic concepts—such as culture—and research methods—such as participant observation—we learn how anthropologists seek to understand, document, and explain the stunning variety of human cultures and ways of organizing society. This course encourages you to consider how looking behind cultural assumptions helps anthropologists solve real world dilemmas.Sophomore Priority.",Spring 2025,"CX, Cultural/Linguistics, IS, International Studies, SI, Social Inquiry, WR2 Writing Requirement 2","AMMU Music Foundations, ARCN Pertinent, CCST Seeing and Being Cross-Cult, CL: 100 level",,Pamela Feldman-Savelsberg,"T, TH",CMC 209,1:15pm-3:00pm,
SOAN 111,Introduction to Sociology,6 credits,"Sociology is an intellectual discipline, spanning the gap between the sciences and humanities while often (though not always) involving itself in public policy debates, social reform, and political activism. Sociologists study a startling variety of topics using qualitative and quantitative methods. Still, amidst all this diversity, sociology is centered on a set of core historical theorists (Marx/Weber/Durkheim) and research topics (race/class/gender inequality). We will explore these theoretical and empirical foundations by reading and discussing influential texts and select topics in the study of social inequality while relating them to our own experiences and understanding of the social world.Sophomore Priority.",Spring 2025,"SI, Social Inquiry","AMMU Music Foundations, CCST Seeing and Being Cross-Cult, CL: 100 level",,Liz Raleigh,"M, W",Leighton 236,8:30am-9:40am,
SOAN 214,Neighborhoods and Cities: Inequalities and Identities,6 credits,"Inequalities and identities are well understood yet too often disconnected from the context of space and place. In this class, we discuss the ways that neighborhoods and cities are sites of inequality as well as identity. Neighborhoods are linked to the amount of wealth we hold; the schools we attend; the goods, services, and resources we have access to; and who our neighbors are. Neighborhoods are also spaces where identities and community are created, claimed, and contested. They can also be sites of conflict as they change through gentrification or other processes that often reflect inequalities of power, resources, and status. In this course, special attention will be paid to how race, gender and sexuality, and immigration shape inequalities and identity in neighborhoods and cities. This course will also include an academic civic engagement component, collaborating with local communities in Minnesota.The department strongly recommends that Sociology/Anthropology 110 or 111 be taken prior to enrolling in courses numbered 200 or above.",Spring 2025,"IDS, Intercultural Domestic Studies, QRE, Quantitative Reasoning, SI, Social Inquiry, WR2 Writing Requirement 2","ACE Applied, AFST Social Inquiry, CL: 200 level, AMST Space and Place",,Daniel Williams,"T, TH",Leighton 426,3:10pm-4:55pm,

From smiling at strangers to addressing a woman as “ma’am,” what is polite in one setting can be strange or antagonistic in another. This course focuses on cross-linguistic expressions of (im)politeness and (dis)respect, but also touches upon non-verbal behavior and communication. Older cross-cultural literature has focused on the positive valuations of politeness, deference, and respect in language. By balancing past scholarship with recent works on linguistic impoliteness and disrespect, we’ll explore language’s role in social relations, from creating harmony to sowing conflict.
