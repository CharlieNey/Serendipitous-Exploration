Cosmological mandalas, hell images, travel brochures, and military maps bring to light the imagined Japan—its religious vision, cartographic imagination, and political ambition—that dictated its geopolitical expansion abroad and the displacement of minority peoples “at home.” We will use a variety of textual and visual materials, including those in Carleton’s Rare Book and Map Collections.","Historically work has been a central location for the constitution of gender identities for both men and women; at the same time, cultural notions of gender have shaped the labor market. We will investigate the roles of race, class, and ethnicity in shaping multiple sexual divisions of labor and the ways in which terms such as skill, bread-winning and work itself were gendered. Topics will include domestic labor, slavery, industrialization, labor market segmentation, protective legislation, and the labor movement.","[('Tthe', 0.6313267946243286)]"

We’ll read texts from these authors that became foundational for the later history of philosophy, including the Apology, Gorgias, Symposium, and the Nicomachean Ethics, while situating the ancient understanding of virtue in the context of larger questions of metaphysics (the nature of being), psychology, and ethics.","We explore literature, music, and the fine arts of German-speaking countries around the topics of gender and sex(uality). We focus on the years between 1880 and 1920 in Austria-Hungary, but also venture into more recent times and other localities. How did images of men and women change over time? How did science factor into these images? What was/is considered “normal” when it comes to sex(uality) and gender, and what German-speaking voices have been pushing against those norms? How did these voices use literature, music, and the fine arts to reflect or criticize such norms? Taught in English.","[('5', 0.6108353137969971)]"

We will consider language as it relates to social status, age, gender, ethnicity, and location as well as theoretical models used to study variation. We will also examine how language is used in conversation, in the media, and beyond using ethnography of communication and discourse analysis.

This course assumes competence with simple algebra, but no prior chemistry experience.","Optimization is all about selecting the ""best"" thing. Finding the most likely strategy to win a game, the route that gets you there the fastest, or the curve that most closely fits given data are all examples of optimization problems. In this course we study linear optimization (also known as linear programming), the simplex method, and duality from both a theoretical and a computational perspective. Applications will be selected from statistics, economics, computer science, and more. Additional topics in nonlinear and convex optimization will be covered as time permits.","[('Their', 0.703491747379303)]"

We will consider how individual writers and artists contribute to the conversation.
