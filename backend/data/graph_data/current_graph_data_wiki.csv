ARCN 112-00 - Native North America,AMST 321-00 - Indigenous Chicago: Indigenous Histories and Futures in Zhegagoynak,0.9306827,"When did humans first migrate to North America? How long have people lived in Minnesota? This course will examine the material culture of Indigenous peoples throughout the North American continent above Mexico, from c. 20,000 years ago to present. Cultural groups include the Inuit, Iroquois, ancient Puebloans, Cahokia, Great Plains villages, and Pacific Northwest (Kumash) peoples. We will study Indigenous oral histories, genetic data, linguistics, material remains, and ethnohistorical accounts to examine migration, trade, and contact, with an emphasis on decolonization and Indigenous archaeologies.","Before Chicago as we know it today existed, many Indigenous nations had long standing relationships with this place. They knew it as Zhegagoynak, Gaa-zhigaagwanzhikaag, Zhigaagong, Šikaakonki, Shekâkôheki, Sekākoh, and Gųųšge honąk, among others. This course emerges from four years of community-engaged curriculum development and examines Chicago histories through five themes: Chicago's lands and environment, Chicago as a Native place, Chicago as a place of convergence, activism and resistance in Chicago, and community-driven education movements in Chicago. Drawing from History, American Studies, Education, and Indigenous Studies, students will also examine how research and curricula can center Indigenous perspectives and sources.","indigenous, material, court, judge, present","indigenous, material, court, judge, present",indigenous years

From politics and pop culture, to religious philosophies and spiritual practices, to rituals, scriptures, gender, religious authority, and more, students will explore how these issues emerge in a variety of religions, places, and historical moments in the U.S. and across the globe.","From ancient to present times, Japan drew and redrew its borders, shape, and culture, imagining its place in this world and beyond, its cultural and racial identity. This course is a cartographic exploration of this complex and contested history. Cosmological mandalas, hell images, travel brochures, and military maps bring to light the imagined Japan—its religious vision, cartographic imagination, and political ambition—that dictated its geopolitical expansion abroad and the displacement of minority peoples “at home.” We will use a variety of textual and visual materials, including those in Carleton’s Rare Book and Map Collections.","religion, history, culture, middle, century","play, production, performance, project, social",religious history

The beginning of the seminar will be focused on critically examining a number of theoretical approaches to the study of genre and fandom. Building on these approaches, the remainder of the course will focus on cult television case studies from the last eight decades. We will draw on recent scholarship to explore how cult television functions textually, industrially, and culturally. Additionally, we will study fan communities on the Internet and consider how fansites, webisodes, and sites like YouTube and Netflix transform television genres.","music, genre, musical, game, audio","music, genre, musical, game, audio",production music

We will examine a number of socio-technical systems (such as wikis, social media platforms, and citizen science projects), discuss the design principles used to build them, and analyze how they help people mobilize and collaborate with one another. Assignments will involve investigating datasets from online platforms and exploring current research in the field.","human, relationship, cultural, culture, war","psychology, research, seminar, social, history",social various

Moreover, citizens are increasingly willing to call into question the legitimacy of this country’s core electoral and governing institutions. How did the U.S. get to this point? What can be done about it? This course will examine political polarization as a central feature of American politics and the consequences for American democracy.","This course examines the growth of modern science since the Renaissance with an emphasis on the Scientific Revolution, the development of scientific methodology, and the emergence of new scientific disciplines. How might a history of science focused on scientific networks operating within society, rather than on individual scientists, change our understanding of “genius,” “progress,” and “scientific impartiality?” We will consider a range of scientific developments, treating science both as a body of knowledge and as a set of practices, and will gauge the extent to which our knowledge of the natural world is tied to who, when, and where such knowledge has been produced and circulated.","politic, life, american, gender, america","psychology, research, seminar, social, history",rather experts

Descriptions of motion and change in motion of some simple systems at human speeds are investigated using Newton’s laws, vector analysis, and the conservation laws of momentum and energy. The course moves beyond the Newtonian framework to consider a relativistic framework where time and space are intertwined and explores the motion of objects whose speeds approach the speed of light. Comfort with algebra and the integration and differentiation of elementary functions is assumed. Weekly laboratory work.  This section of introductory physics with problem solving is periodically offered for students who wish to further develop their general analytical and critical thinking skills.

But what role do carnivals play in the construction of national and collective identities? We will try to answer this and other questions focusing on films, paintings, and literary texts from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries that represent some of the most popular carnivals in Latin America: Candombe (Uruguay), Yawar Fiesta (Peru), Blacks and Whites (Colombia), Oruro (Bolivia), and Rio (Brazil). We will analyze them from an interdisciplinary perspective that includes literary criticism, anthropology, and history. Students will engage with debates about nation, popular culture, modernity/modernization, and intangible cultural heritage.","Food is both a biological necessity and a cultural symbol. We eat to survive, we “are what we eat,” and delicious foods are “to die for.” What does this all mean in the context of Latin America, which gave us the origins of peanut butter (peanuts), spaghetti sauce (tomatoes), avocado toast (avocados), french fries (potatoes), and power bowls (quinoa)? In this class, we will explore the long history humans have had with food in Latin America, drawing from archaeology, ethnohistory, and anthropology to explore the relationship between food, culture, power, identity, gender, and ethnicity.","religion, history, culture, middle, century","chinese, friendship, food, cultural, japanese",cultural culture

A major who is considering off-campus study in the junior year should consult with their adviser on when to take History 298.","This course begins with an introduction to classical mechanics using the Newtonian worldview. Descriptions of motion and change in motion of some simple systems at human speeds are investigated using Newton’s laws, vector analysis, and the conservation laws of momentum and energy. The course moves beyond the Newtonian framework to consider a relativistic framework where time and space are intertwined and explores the motion of objects whose speeds approach the speed of light. Comfort with algebra and the integration and differentiation of elementary functions is assumed. Weekly laboratory work.  This section of introductory physics with problem solving is periodically offered for students who wish to further develop their general analytical and critical thinking skills. The smaller section will have additional class meetings for problem solving and review. PHYS 142 is appropriate for students who would like to have more scheduled time to work with a faculty member on developing their scientific reasoning skills and understanding of the foundations of physics.","psychology, research, seminar, social, history","science, genetic, concept, level, function",would take

Topics include separation of variables; phase portraits; equilibria and their stability; non-dimensionalization; bifurcation analysis; and modeling of physical, biological, chemical, and social processes.","In this seminar, we will examine the psychology of LGBTQ+ people, focusing on topics such as LGBTQ+ identity development; predictors and consequences of anti-LGBTQ+ bias and discrimination; the health and well-being of LGBTQ+ people; and familial and relationship dynamics of LGBTQ+ populations. We will consider psychology's history of—and potential for—both contributing to and dismantling the inequities faced by LGBTQ+ populations.","datum, variable, integral, research, participant","right, century, lgbtq, debate, spain",dynamics social
