"While many claims are made about the benefits of learning Latin, here’s what we know for sure: it’s a beautiful language, both intensely precise and rigorous, as well as poetically expressive and inviting."
"Spoken by millions in the ancient world and kept continuously “alive” up to the present, Latin provides a window onto an intellectual and cultural landscape that is both foreign and familiar to modern students."
"This beginning course will develop necessary vocabulary, forms, and grammar that allows students to begin reading short passages of unadulterated prose and poetry from the ancient Roman world right from the start."
What are the “rules” of friendship?
Would you do anything for a friend?Anything?
The ancient Romans were no strangers to the often paradoxical demands of friendship and love.
"The goal for Intermediate Latin Prose and Poetry is to gain experience in the three major modes of Latin expression most often encountered “in the wild”—prose, poetry, and inscriptions—while exploring the notion of friendship."
"By combining all three modes into this one course, we hope both to create a suitable closure to the language sequence and to provide a reasonable foundation for further exploration of Roman literature and culture."
This course is intended for students who have completed Latin 204 (or equivalent) and wish to maintain and deepen their language skills.
"Students will meet weekly to review prepared passages, as well as reading at sight."
Actual reading content will be determined prior to the start of term by the instructor in consultation with the students who have enrolled.
"There will be brief, periodic assessments of language comprehension throughout the term."
"We've all been taught that nouns are people, places, and things."
"Yet, these seemingly simple linguistic objects are surprisingly complex."
"For instance, languages vary in what information (e.g., case, gender, person, number) nouns display."
"Even within a single language, the form of a noun may change depending on its function within a sentence or its function within a conversation."
This course uses contemporary linguistic theories to account for the many varied forms of nouns throughout the world's languages.
No familiarity with languages other than English is required.Held for new first year students
This course is organized to enable the student to actively participate in the construction of a rather elaborate theory of the nature of human cognitive capacity to acquire and use natural languages.
"In particular, we concentrate on one aspect of that capacity: the unconscious acquisition of a grammar that enables a speaker of a language to produce and recognize sentences that have not been previously encountered."
"In the first part of the course, we concentrate on gathering notation and terminology intended to allow an explicit and manageable description."
"In the second part, we depend on written and oral student contributions in a cooperative enterprise of theory construction."
There is a complex relationship between language and society.
This course examines how language variation is tied to identity and the role of language in human social interaction.
"We will consider language as it relates to social status, age, gender, ethnicity, and location as well as theoretical models used to study variation."
"We will also examine how language is used in conversation, in the media, and beyond using ethnography of communication and discourse analysis."
You will become more aware of how language is used in your own daily life and will be able to argue sociolinguistic perspectives on language attitudes.
"Although no two utterances are ever exactly the same, we humans don’t function like tape recorders; we overlook distinctions to which mechanical recording devices are sensitive, and we “hear” contrasts which are objectively not there."
What we (think we) hear is determined by the sound system of the language we speak.
"This course examines the sound systems of human languages, focusing on how speech sounds are produced and perceived, and how these units come to be organized into a systematic network in the minds of speakers of languages."
"Register for this course by submitting theIndependentReading/Study/ResearchForm, which requires approval from the project faculty supervisor."
"What moves where, how, and for what purpose?"
"In this course, participants explore accounts of various types of syntactic movement within the Minimalist Program."

Students will use these tools to model real world problems and solve these problems using computational software.This course is not open to students who have received credit for MATH 232.
"Vectors, curves, partial derivatives, gradient, multiple and iterated integrals, line integrals, Green’s theorem."
Linear algebra centers on the study of highly structured functions called linear transformations.
"Given the abundance of nonlinear functions in mathematics, it may come as a surprise that restricting to linear ones opens the door to a rich and powerful theory that finds applications throughout mathematics, statistics, computer science, and the natural and social sciences."
"Linear transformations are everywhere, once we know what to look for."
They appear in calculus as the functions that are used to define lines and planes in Euclidean space.
"In fact, differentiation is also a linear transformation that takes one function to another."
The course focuses on developing geometric intuition as well as computational matrix methods.
"Topics include kernel and image of a linear transformation, vector spaces, determinants, eigenvectors and eigenvalues.This course is not open to students who have received credit for MATH 134."
Basic concepts and techniques used throughout mathematics.

"Homomorphisms and quotient structures, polynomials, unique factorization."
"Other topics may include applications such as Burnside’s counting theorem, symmetry groups, polynomial equations, or geometric constructions."
Differential geometry is the study of shapes (like curves and surfaces) using tools from linear algebra and calculus.
"In this course we focus on the differential geometry of curves and surfaces and the concepts of curvature, geodesics, and first and second fundamental forms."
"These concepts will lead us to remarkable results like the Theorem Egregium and the Gauss-Bonnet Theorem, which relate the ways that curvature and shape interact."
"Register for this course by submitting theIndependent Reading/Study/Research Form, which requires approval from the project faculty supervisor."
"As part of their senior capstone experience, majors will work together in teams to develop advanced knowledge in a faculty-specified area or application of mathematics, and to design and implement the first stage of a project completed the following term."

In the West mental illness has traditionally been approached with a biomedical model that views it as independent of culture.
"By contrast the “relativist” position assumes that, to a large extent, human behaviors are culturally determined and that the etiology and manifestation of mental disorders are affected by society and culture."
"This course will address such issues as well as their implications for assessment and treatment through an examination of several Western and non-Western societies, with a special emphasis on Czech society."
"There will be several guest lectures by Czech psychology professors as well as excursions within Prague to psychiatric hospitals and clinics, where students will meet with Czech clinicians and patients."
"With the aging population comes a variety of challenges, including those to cognitive health and decline."
Neurodegenerative diseases create various forms of dementia and cause unique problems beyond those that are an outcome of healthy aging.
"The disabling effects of aging and dementia extend beyond the person to family, friends and wider community."
The need to understand and extend knowledge of both healthy aging and the pathological changes that occur with neurodegenerative diseases with aging is of great importance.
"By understanding how the brain is impacted by age, dementia, and other clinical syndromes, both management of the cognitive issues and advances in treatments to improve mental functioning can be made."
This course takes a neuropsychological approach to study healthy aging and neurodegenerative disease.
"In this seminar, lectures and discussions explore the cognitive, behavioral, and molecular aspects of healthy aging and neurodegenerative disease processes in humans."
"Cognitive topics include working memory, long term memory, attention, familiarity and recollection, emotion, and social factors that interact with aging."
"The physiological and cognitive outcomes of neurodegenerative conditions such as Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, and various types of dementia are compared with the physiology and cognitive decline evident in healthy aging."
"Students will read primary articles on these topics, and propose a project based on course discussion and interactions with people at senior centers and convalescent centers in Northfield."

Students are then mentored through a substantial paper related to the seminar topic.
"For nearly two thousand years, Christians have considered Jesus the unique, miracle-working Son of God who came to earth to save humanity from its sins."
But does this picture hold up to historical scrutiny?
Who do historians think Jesus was?
This seminar introduces the tools of historical inquiry that scholars use to reconstruct Jesus's original message.
"It also surveys how Americans in different cultural contexts have imagined Jesus, from the liberating Christ of Black theology, to the eastern sage and hippie of the 1960s, to the rabbi who never intended a non-Jewish movement.Held for new first year students"
"The Qur'an is best known as the sacred text of Islam, but it is also one of the most widely read, dynamic, and influential texts in human history."
It is not every text that can compel people to regard it as divine revelation.
"In fact, Muslims consider the Qur'an's literary composition a miracle."
This course explores the literary style and structure of the Qur'an through close reading of its English translation.

"In addition to regular class sessions, there will be a weeklykyudo(Japanese archery) practice on Wednesday evening (7-9 pm), which will enable students to study samurai history in context through gaining first-hand experience in the ritualized practice ofkyudo.Extra Time for weekly kyudo (Japanese archery) practice on Wednesday evening (7-9 pm)"
How do we define traditions if they change over time and are marked by internal conflict?
"Is there anything stable about a religious tradition—an essence, or a set of practices or beliefs that abide amidst diversity and mark it off from a surrounding culture or religion?"
How do people live out or re-invent their traditions in the modern world?
"In this seminar we explore questions about pluralism, identity, authority, and truth, and we examine the creative ways beliefs and practices change in relation to culture."

"Sociology is an intellectual discipline, spanning the gap between the sciences and humanities while often (though not always) involving itself in public policy debates, social reform, and political activism."
Sociologists study a startling variety of topics using qualitative and quantitative methods.
"Still, amidst all this diversity, sociology is centered on a set of core historical theorists (Marx/Weber/Durkheim) and research topics (race/class/gender inequality)."
We will explore these theoretical and empirical foundations by reading and discussing influential texts and select topics in the study of social inequality while relating them to our own experiences and understanding of the social world.Sophomore Priority.

"Like any other life skill, thinking differently and embracing active mindfulness takes training, a willingness to learn, and dedicated hard work."
"This course is designed to help students and athletes think differently about various aspects of training and competition, ultimately using these skills as they apply to sport, functioning in team environments, and most importantly to the other areas of their lives outside of athletics during and beyond their time at Carleton."
"In every academic discipline, we make theories and argue for and against them."
This is as true of theology as of geology (and as true of phys ed as of physics).
What are the resources we have available to us in making these arguments?
"It’s tempting to split the terrain into (i) raw data, and (ii) rules of right reasoning for processing the data."
"The most obvious source of raw data is sense experience, and the most obvious candidates for modes of right reasoning are deduction, induction, and abduction."
"Some philosophers, however, think that sense perception is only one of several sources of raw data (perhaps we also have a faculty of pure intuition or maybe a moral sense), and others have doubted that we have any source of raw data at all."
"As for the modes of “right” reasoning, Hume famously worried about our (in)ability to justify induction, and others have had similar worries about abduction and even deduction."
Can more be said on behalf of our most strongly held beliefs and belief-forming practices than simply that we find them seductive—that we are attracted to them; that they resonate with us?
"In this course, we’ll use some classic historical and contemporary philosophical texts to help us explore these and related issues."
How should we live?
This is the fundamental question for the study of ethics.
This course looks at classic and contemporary answers to the fundamental question from Socrates to Kant to modern day thinkers.
"Along the way, we consider slightly (but only slightly) more tractable questions such as: What reason is there to be moral?"
"Is there such a thing as moral knowledge (and if so, how do we get it)?"
What are the fundamental principles of right and wrong (if there are any at all)?
Is morality objective?
What is a good human life?
Who is a good person?
"From the time of Plato and Aristotle onwards, many philosophers have thought about these questions in terms of two central ideas.Virtues, such as justice or courage, make us a certain type of person (they give us a certain character).Wisdomenables us to make good judgments about how to act."
How do virtue and wisdom work together to produce a good human life?
Is a good life the same as a happy life?
"We will reflect on these and related questions as we read texts from Alasdair MacIntyre, Philippa Foot, and other significant thinkers in the contemporary virtue ethics tradition."
"We will also consider the application of virtue ethics to specific areas, such as environmental ethics, as well as the parallels between Western virtue ethics and the tradition of Confucianism in ancient China."
"Our inquiry into seventeenth and eighteenth century philosophy is not limited to any geographic region: it is open to Indigenous philosophical traditions as well as those of Europe, the Americas, Africa, and Asia."
"We will cover selections from Anton Wilhelm Amo, Mulla Sadra, Sor Juana Inés de La Cruz, Im Yunjidang, Isaac Newton, Baruch Spinoza, Immanuel Kant, and more."
"The topics include, but are not limited to, the mind body distinction, divinity, love, freedom, virtue, and the good life."
"The final paper project for this course asks you to creatively connect philosophical concepts, themes, or problems from different units of the course."
Latina feminist philosophers have developed and continue to develop valuable philosophical contributions to feminist scholarship and the discipline of philosophy more broadly.
"This course sheds light on these contributions by exploring the major questions, concepts, and debates within the Latina (and Latinx) feminist philosophical tradition."
"We will specifically explore the relationships between race/ethnicity, class, gender, sexuality, and identity; lived experience, embodiment, and knowledge; and the possibilities for self/social transformation through the process of creative writing."
"Register for this course by submitting theIndependent Reading/Study/Research Form, which requires approval from the project faculty supervisor."
"When one is told, “Take good care of yourself!” the reflexive ‘yourself’ refers to both the object and agent of care."
"What is it, this ‘self’, and how do you take good care of it?"
"This course will discuss historical and contemporary answers to these questions, as well as the related notions of identity, personhood, agency, and self-knowledge."
"Moreover, some philosophical traditions deny the existence of the self; in their account of living well, what is experiencing the living?"
"Or, if we understand the self as relational, does one need to take care of others to take care of oneself?"
"Finally, if one’s self is socially constructed, how do we change society to avoid its possible disfiguring influences on the self and to enable every self’s flourishing?"
"The planning, preparation, and completion of a philosophical paper under the direction of a member of the department and as part of a seminar group."
This course begins with an introduction to classical mechanics using the Newtonian worldview.
"Descriptions of motion and change in motion of some simple systems at human speeds are investigated using Newton’s laws, vector analysis, and the conservation laws of momentum and energy."

"An introduction to research method, research design, and the analysis of political data."
The course is intended to introduce students to the fundamentals of scientific inquiry as they are employed in the discipline.
"The course will consider the philosophy of scientific research generally, the philosophy of social science research, theory building and theory testing, the components of applied (quantitative and qualitative) research across the major sub-fields of political science, and basic methodological tools."
Intended for majors only.
"Linear modeling using statistical techniques and equilibrium-centered, game-theoretic approaches are standard methods in quantitative social science."
"However, research into complex systems suggests that dynamic, chaotic and non-linear processes are common in networked, multi-actor systems."
Equilibrium may also be difficult to achieve in a world of adaptive or evolutionary agents.
How do these concepts apply to our political world?
"In this class we will explore agent-based models related to political, social and policy questions while student build their own models using the open-source NetLogo language."
Prerequisite: POSC 230
This course explores the case study method for investigating important political science questions.
"We will begin by discussing the philosophy of science, causality, theory building and testing; this will provide us with the grounding to think critically about the uses, strengths, and limitations of case study methods."
"We will then explore the core issues of case study research design, including methods of comparison, case selection, process tracing, and building cases into mixed method studies."
"We will also explore how various techniques such as interviews, participant observation, and archival research contribute to building case studies."
"In the aftermath of 9/11, the U.S. launched the Global War on Terror to purportedly find, stop,and defeat every terrorist group with a global reach."
"Without question, the Global War on Terror has radically shaped everything from U.S. foreign policies and domestic institutions to civil liberties and pop culture."
"In this course, we will examine the events of 9/11 and then critically assess the immediate and long-term ramifications of the endless Global War on Terror on different states and communities around the world."
"While we will certainly spend time interrogating U.S. policies from the Bush, Obama, and Trump administrations, we will also examine reactions to those policies across both the global north and the global south."
The modern age has been characterized by the unprecedented advance of natural science and the attempt to achieve technological mastery of nature.
How did this come about?
"What worldview does this express, and how does that worldview affect the way we live and think?"
"We will investigate these questions by studying classic works by some of modernity‘s philosophic founders (including Bacon, Descartes, and Hobbes) as well as some of its most penetrating interpreters and critics (including Jonathan Swift, Rousseau, and Nietzsche)."
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to comparative and international public policy.
"It examines major theories and approaches to public policy design and implementation in several major areas: international policy economy (including the study of international trade and monetary policy, financial regulation, and comparative welfare policy), global public health and comparative healthcare policy, institutional development (including democratic governance, accountability systems, and judicial reform), and environmental public policy."
Recommended Preparation: STAT 120 is strongly recommended.
This course addresses race and ethnicity in U.S. politics.
"Following an introduction to historical, sociological, and psychological approaches to the study of race and ethnicity, we apply these approaches to understanding the ways in which racial attitudes have been structured along a number of political and policy dimensions, e.g., welfare, education, criminal justice."
"Students will gain an increased understanding of the multiple contexts that shape contemporary racial and ethnic politics and policies in the U.S., and will consider the role of institutional design, policy development, representation, and racial attitudes among the general U.S. public and political environment."
Ideological fanaticism is on the rise today.
"Individuals prefer the incantation of slogans and clichés to autonomous thinking, moderation, and care for the diversity and complexity of circumstances and of human beings."
"The results are the inability to converse across differences and the tendency to ostracize and exclude others in the name of tribal and populist nationalism, as well as of racism."
"Hannah Arendt called totalitarianism this form of ideological hypnosis, which characterizes not only totalitarian political regimes, but can also colonize liberal-democracies."
In this class we will read some of the works of Arendt to better understand the power of imagination to enhance critical and independent thinking and resist totalitarianism.
This course focuses on the historic and modern use of violence or the threat of violence by non-state actors to secure political outcomes.
"We will review the strategy and tactics of various terror groups, use case studies to understand the logic of terrorism, assess why some groups succeed while others fail, and study terrorist organizations’ efforts at recruitment and indoctrination."
"These topics will be addressed from theoretical and practical perspectives, with input from expert guest speakers."
"Finally, we will assess counterterrorism measures, including the moral, ethical, legal, and practical approaches to creating security in the modern world."
"This course covers the U.S. Intelligence Community, how intelligence supports national security policy development, and how intelligence is applied to execute strategy in pursuit of policy objectives (specifically, implementation of national security and foreign policy initiatives)."

The course concludes with the study of asymmetric/hybrid warfare in our modern age and how intelligence might be used to better understand the changing dynamics of future global conflict.
Foreign policy analysis is a distinct sub-field within international relations that focuses on explaining the actions and choices of actors in world politics.
"After a review of the historical development of the sub-field, we will explore approaches to foreign policy that emphasize the empirical testing of hypotheses that explain how policies and choices are formulated and implemented."
The psychological sources of foreign policy decisions (including leaders' beliefs and personalities and the effect of decision-making groups) are a central theme.
Completion of a lower level IR course and the stats/methods sequence is recommended preparation.
This course explores theories about spaces/places and investigates the impact of our physical environment on a broad range of social and political issues.

"Students will engage with important contemporary issues such as residential segregation, public space management, protest policing, etc."
"Most of the course will focus on urban politics, with a brief foray into rural issues."
The goal of this course is to encourage students to think about everyday environmental features in a more systematic and theoretic manner and design social scientific inquiries into spatial issues.
"Informed by the assigned readings, students will visit markets, factories, farms, and various cultural and natural sites to see first-hand the changes and challenges occurring in these areas."
The course covers: (1) issues of livelihood transition from rural to urban; (2) the interaction between market systems and social relations; and (3) the impact on society of changes in physical infrastructures such as roads and telecommunication.

"How can we best understand the role of religion in the world today, and how should we interpret the meaning of religious traditions–their texts and practices–in history and culture?"
This class takes an exciting tour through selected themes and puzzles related to the fascinating and diverse expressions of religion throughout the world.
"From politics and pop culture, to religious philosophies and spiritual practices, to rituals, scriptures, gender, religious authority, and more, students will explore how these issues emerge in a variety of religions, places, and historical moments in the U.S. and across the globe."
This course is a general introduction to Islam as a prophetic religious tradition.
"It explores the different ways Muslims have interpreted and put into practice the prophetic message of Muhammad through analyses of varying theological, legal, political, mystical, and literary writings as well as through Muslims’ lived histories."
These analyses aim for students to develop a framework for explaining the sources and vocabularies through which historically specific human experiences and understandings of the world have been signified as Islamic.
The course will focus primarily on the early and modern periods of Islamic history.
Mind and body are often considered separate but not equal; the mind gives commands to the body and the body complies.
"Exploring the ways the three religious traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam think about the body will deepen our understanding of the mind-body relationship."
We will ask questions such as: How does the body direct the mind?
"How do religious practices discipline the body and the mind, and how do habits of body and mind change the forms and meanings of these practices?"
"Gender, sexuality, sensuality, and bodily function will be major axes of analysis."
"The concept of law plays a central role in religion, and the concept of religion plays a central role in law."
We often use the word ‘law’ to describe obligatory religious practices.
"But is that ‘law,’ as compared with state law?"
"Legal systems in the U.S. and Europe make laws that protect religious people, and that protect governments from religion."
But what does ‘religion’ mean in a legal context?
And how do implicit notions of religious law affect how judges deal with religion?
We will explore these questions using sources drawn from contemporary religions and recent legal disputes.
Is God on the side of the poor?
"This course explores how liberation theologians have called for justice, social change, and resistance by drawing on fundamental sources in Christian tradition and by using economic and political theories to address poverty, racism, oppression, gender injustice, and more."
"We explore the principles of liberationist thought, including black theology, Latin American liberation theology, and feminist theology through writings of various contemporary thinkers."
"We also examine the social settings out of which these thinkers have emerged, their critiques of “traditional” theologies, and the new vision of community they have developed in various contexts."
How does power flow and concentrate in the Catholic Church?
"What are the gendered aspects of the Church’s structure, history, and theology?"
"Through readings, discussions, and analysis of current media, students will develop the ability to critically and empathetically interpret issues of gender, sexuality, and power in the Catholic Church, especially as these issues appear in official Vatican texts."

"Christianity, by its very name, focuses on Jesus."
"This course shifts the focus to Mary, his mother: her various manifestations and her contributions to the myriad experiences of peoples around the world."
"Race, gender, class, and feminist and liberation theologies come into play as Mary presents as: the Mother of God; queen of heaven; a Black madonna; a Mestiza madonna; an exceptional woman with her own chapter in the Qur'an; various goddesses in Haitian Vodoun, Hinduism, and Buddhism; a tattoo on the backs of U.S. prisoners–and so on."
"In addition to considering Miriam (her Jewish name) as she appears in literature, art, apparition, and ritual practice around the world, we will also consider Mary Magdalene, her foil, who appears in popular discourse from the Gnostic gospels to The Da Vinci Code."

"What, exactly, is religion and what conditions of modernity have made it urgent to articulate such a question in the first place?"
Why does religion exert such force in human society and history?
Is it an opiate of the masses or an illusion laden with human wish-fulfillment?
Is it a social glue?
A subjective experience of the sacred?
"Is it simply a universalized Protestant Christianity in disguise, useful in understanding, and colonizing, the non-Christian world?"
"This seminar, for junior majors and advanced majors from related fields, explores generative theories from anthropology, sociology, psychology, literary studies, and the history of religions."
"This seminar will acquaint students with research tools in various fields of religious studies, provide an opportunity to present and discuss research work in progress, hone writing skills, and improve oral presentation techniques."
Continues Russian 101.

"Anthropology is the study of all human beings in all their diversity, an exploration of what it means to be human throughout the globe."
"This course helps us to see ourselves, and others, from a new perspective."
"By examining specific analytic concepts—such as culture—and research methods—such as participant observation—we learn how anthropologists seek to understand, document, and explain the stunning variety of human cultures and ways of organizing society."
This course encourages you to consider how looking behind cultural assumptions helps anthropologists solve real world dilemmas.Sophomore Priority.
"Sociology is an intellectual discipline, spanning the gap between the sciences and humanities while often (though not always) involving itself in public policy debates, social reform, and political activism."
Sociologists study a startling variety of topics using qualitative and quantitative methods.
"Still, amidst all this diversity, sociology is centered on a set of core historical theorists (Marx/Weber/Durkheim) and research topics (race/class/gender inequality)."
We will explore these theoretical and empirical foundations by reading and discussing influential texts and select topics in the study of social inequality while relating them to our own experiences and understanding of the social world.Sophomore Priority.
"This course introduces linguistic anthropology, the study of language in social contexts."
People use language to navigate the world and to make judgments about others.
Has anyone ever correctly guessed your background after you used a specific word (pop vs. soda)?
Have you ever been teased due to your accent?
"By surveying cross-cultural research from around the world, we ask: How do linguistic practices contribute to the construction of social identity and social difference?"
How might perceptions of language create and reinforce social divisions and inequality?
Students will also consider ways they may advocate for linguistic social justice.
"How is it that in specific historical moments ordinary people come together and undertake collective struggles for justice in social movements such as Black Lives Matter, Me Too, Standing Rock, immigrant, and LGBTQ rights?"
"How have these movements theorized oppression, and what has been their vision for liberation?"
What collective change strategies have they proposed and what obstacles have they faced?
"We will explore specific case studies and use major sociological perspectives theorizing the emergence of movements, repertoires of protest, collective identity formation, frame alignment, and resource mobilization."
"We will foreground the intersectionality of gender, sexuality, race, and class in these movements."
American sociology has a rich tradition of focusing the ethnographic eye on the American experience.
"We will take advantage of this tradition to encounter urban America through the ethnographic lens, expanding our social vision and investigating the nature of race, place, meaning, interaction, and inequality in the U.S."
"While doing so, we will also explore the unique benefits, challenges, and underlying assumptions of ethnographic research as a distinctive mode of acquiring and communicating social knowledge."
"As such, this course offers both an immersion in the American experience and an inquiry into the craft of ethnographic writing and research.The department strongly recommends that Sociology/Anthropology 110 or 111 be taken prior to enrolling in courses numbered 200 or above."
"Immigration has been a defining feature of the United States that is tied to legal and cultural forms of citizenship, and more broadly, to questions of belonging."
"This course explores these three concepts through multiple aspects of immigration, including the migration experience, immigration policy, community, education, culture, and others, for both immigrants and the children of immigrants."
"Special attention is given to how differences among immigrants—such as race, gender, class, national origin, and others—matter in all of these areas."
"These questions and issues are explored through academic readings, popular and public discourse, immigrant voices, and civic engagement in local communities.The department strongly recommends that 110 or 11 be taken prior to enrolling in courses number 200 or above."
"Our ways of perceiving and acting in the world emerge simultaneously from learned and shared orientations of long duration, and from specific contexts and contingencies of the moment."
This applies to the production of anthropological ideas and of anthropology as an academic discipline.
"This course examines anthropological theory by placing the observers and the observed in the same comparative historical framework, subject to the ethnographic process and to historical conditions in and out of academe."
"We seek to understand genealogies of ideas, building on and/or reacting to previous anthropological approaches."
"We highlight the diversity of voices who thought up these ideas, and have influenced anthropological thought through time."
"We attend to the intellectual and political context in which anthropologists conducted research, wrote, and published their works, as well as which voices did/did not reach academic audiences."
"The course thus traces the development of the core issues, central debates, internecine battles, and diversity of anthropological thought and of anthropologists that have animated anthropology since it first emerged as a distinct field of inquiry to present-day efforts at intellectual decolonization.The department strongly recommends that 110 or 11 be taken prior to enrolling in courses number 200 or above."
Senior sociology/anthropology majors fulfill the integrative exercise by writing a senior thesis on a topic approved by the department.
"Students must enroll in six credits to write the thesis, spread as the student likes over Fall, Winter, and Spring terms."
The process begins with the submission of a topic statement in the preceding spring term and concludes with a public presentation in spring of the senior year.

"Within the capitalist system, the concept of dying well (Ars moriendi) has progressively lost its collective sense and meaning, relegated instead to the realm of individual responsibility."
"Simultaneously, the notion of a dignified death has ceased to be an inalienable right for all individuals, becoming contingent upon inherited privileges and access to private resources."
"Death, transformed into a taboo, coexists with an apocalyptic culture and a state of eco-anxiety stemming from ecological crises and the looming extinction of numerous species, potentially including humans."
Some of our guiding questions will be: What implications does dying under capitalist conditions entail?
"Can cultural representation do more than merely comply with, comment or oppose these scenarios?"
"Our exploration will encompass a diverse array of texts, films, and workshops featuring various guest speakers."
