ENGL 395-00 - Senior Seminar (Frankenstein's Progeny),FREN 310-00 - The Art of Scandal,"Written in 1816 when she was only eighteen years old, Mary Shelley’s brilliant and controversial Frankenstein has not only lived on but has sparked two centuries’ worth of adaptations, interpretations, and creative re-imaginings, including recent fiction by Saadawi, McGill, and Tsai, an essay on transgender rage by Stryker, episodes of Black Mirror, and the novel and film Poor Things.  We’ll study how several such radical revisions of the novel explore and extend its prescient themes of gender, sexuality, monstrosity, race, the ethics of science, women’s rights, and social justice.","What is scandal? Is it a product of the time and place where it occurs, or can it transcend national and temporal boundaries? This course seeks answers to these questions by examining the texts, films, and artistic productions that caused, exposed, or critiqued a scandal. We will explore topics such as passion, lies, revenge, rumor, and murder. From the Affair of the Poisons during the reign of Louis XIV to controversy over France’s literary prize (the Goncourt), we will analyze the evolution of social norms and public opinions in global French culture from the seventeenth century to the present day.",0.8360392

From smiling at strangers to addressing a woman as “ma’am,” what is polite in one setting can be strange or antagonistic in another. This course focuses on cross-linguistic expressions of (im)politeness and (dis)respect, but also touches upon non-verbal behavior and communication. Older cross-cultural literature has focused on the positive valuations of politeness, deference, and respect in language. By balancing past scholarship with recent works on linguistic impoliteness and disrespect, we’ll explore language’s role in social relations, from creating harmony to sowing conflict.

This course focuses on the political trajectories of these two rival siblings and looks at the ways in which both states use the other to forge antagonistic and belligerent nations. While this is a survey course it is not a comprehensive overview of the history of the two countries. Instead it covers some of the more significant moments of rupture and violence in the political history of the two states. The first two-thirds of the course offers a top-down, macro overview of these events and processes whereas the last third examines the ways in which people experienced these developments. We use the lens of gender to see how the physical body, especially the body of the woman, is central to the process of nation building. We will consider how women’s bodies become sites of contestation and how they are disciplined and policed by the postcolonial state(s).",0.9073873

Short essays or exams will be required.","Scholar Michael Davidson has suggested that “perhaps the closest link between poetry and disability lies in a conundrum within the genre itself: poetry makes language visible by making language strange."" In this class we will read a wide range of poets who tackle ideas of normalcy and ""ability"" by centering disability consciousness and culture. We will engage with poetry's capacity as a genre to destabilize our assumptions and generate new imaginaries. Alongside contemporary U.S. poetry, we will study contemporary theory in the field of disability studies in order to better understand the critical conversations around the meaning, nature, and consequences of disability.",0.9288125

Most importantly, we shall analyze how their quest for liberation brought America closer to its foundational ideal that all humans are created equal and are endowed with unalienable rights.

Neighborhoods are also spaces where identities and community are created, claimed, and contested. They can also be sites of conflict as they change through gentrification or other processes that often reflect inequalities of power, resources, and status.

From smiling at strangers to addressing a woman as “ma’am,” what is polite in one setting can be strange or antagonistic in another. This course focuses on cross-linguistic expressions of (im)politeness and (dis)respect, but also touches upon non-verbal behavior and communication. Older cross-cultural literature has focused on the positive valuations of politeness, deference, and respect in language. By balancing past scholarship with recent works on linguistic impoliteness and disrespect, we’ll explore language’s role in social relations, from creating harmony to sowing conflict. Expected preparation: prior Sociology/Anthropology course or instructor permission is recommended.","We will address the question of how humans acquire information from the world to support action, learning, belief, choice, and the host of additional mental states that comprise the subject matter of psychology. In other words ""How do we get the outside inside?"" We will initially consider peripheral anatomical structures (e.g., the eye) and proceed through intermediate levels of sensory coding and transmission to cover the brain regions associated with each of the major senses.

Is it different from playing make-believe or code-switching your behavior between family, friends, and classmates? Is it different from what writers do when they write about fictional people? And just what is a person, anyway? A particular body? A set of beliefs and desires? Is an actor’s race and gender independent of those of the person they portray? We’ll evaluate competing answers to such questions from philosophers, cognitive scientists, and theater practitioners.",0.9094016

Potential subjects include Spanish conquistadors and missionaries, early Mexican nation-builders and artists, professional and pseudo-archaeologists, apocalyptic doomsayers, promoters of the Mexican tourist industry, and the counterculture and Chicano movements of the 1960s.

What can be done about it? This course will examine political polarization as a central feature of American politics and the consequences for American democracy.",0.88290834
