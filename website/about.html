                    <h3>Cathy Duan</h3>
                    <p>Hello! My name is Cathy and I’m a senior computer science major from Doylestown, PA. I was interested in this comps project because it’s all about encouraging the liberal arts experience at Carleton, which has helped me discover some of my favorite classes here (from departments like Cinema and Media Studies, American Studies, Sociology, etc.). It was fun to build something that could help the Carleton community and I learned a lot! In my free time, I like to watch movies with friends, go on hikes, and doodle little things on random bits of paper. </p>

                    <h3>Willow Gu</h3>
                    <p>Hello! I am a double major in Computer Science and Cognitive Science with a minor in Statistics and Data Science. I was interested in this project because of its focus on UX design, web design and development, and natural language processing. Additionally, as a Cognitive Science major, I deeply value interdisciplinary approaches and enjoy exploring connections across different departments. In my free time, I enjoy dancing, figure skating, playing guitar, and spending time with my dogs.</p>

                    <p>Hi! I’m a Computer Science and Cinema & Media Studies Double Major at Carleton College. I joined this project because I love interdisciplinary education and was excited to learn about information science and natural language processing. In my free time I enjoy rock climbing, listening to the wind, and hugging my dog named Momo.</p>

                    <h3>Zoey La</h3>
                    <p>Hi there! I’m Zoey and I’m a computer science major! I was interested in our comps topic from the start because I’ve always loved exploring Carleton’s curriculum and planning my class schedule, and with that said, I thought that this project would be something fun and relatable to tackle. Working on it was a very valuable experience, as it helped me develop many technical and soft skills! Outside of school and work, I enjoy playing video games, like Minecraft, Fortnite and Brawl Stars, and binging my favorite TV sitcoms.</p>

                    <p>I’m Kai Weiner, am senior computer science major/math minor at Carleton college. I was drawn to this project because it addressed a problem I was personally interested in- the difficulty of exploring classes at Carleton. In my free time I enjoy hiking, singing and playing music, and spending time with my friends.</p>
